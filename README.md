> Determine the number of days in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

<section class="installation">

## Installation

npm install @stdlib/time-days-in-year
```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var daysInYear = require( '@stdlib/time-days-in-year' );
```

#### daysInYear( \[value] )

Returns the number of days in a year according to the [Gregorian calendar][gregorian-calendar].

```javascript
var num = daysInYear();
// returns <number>
```

By default, the function returns the number of days in the current year (according to local time). To determine the number of days for a particular year, provide either a year or a [`Date`][date-object] object.

```javascript
var num = daysInYear( new Date() );
// returns <number>

num = daysInYear( 2000 );
// returns 366

num = daysInYear( 2017 );
// returns 365
```

-   The function's return value is a generalization and does **not** take into account inaccuracies due to daylight savings conventions, crossing timezones, or other complications with time and dates.
